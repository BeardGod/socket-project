elmsln-install.sh

Run this to install elmsln on a system thatâ€™s already been set in motion to handle it. This means that all the pre-installation procedures have happened either manually via the INSTALL.txt file or using the install step through in the root directory here.

Prior to running this, the root user should most likely run (or at least review) the root/elmsln-preinstall.sh script.

All users that plan to administer ELMSLN in some way should also run the script in users/elmsln-admin-user.sh
