elmsln-preinstall.sh

This must be run as root user on the system in question. It attempts to setup everything automatically instead of needing to run through the INSTALL.txt file. It currently has support for RHEL / CentOS and Ubuntu systems.

This method must be used if planning to utilize data analysis / automated generation methods. Make sure to check ../users/elmsln-admin-user.sh as well since you should always use elmsln (and linux in general) while not the root user.
