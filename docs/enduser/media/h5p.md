Interactive H5P Content
=======================

##Installation
H5P lives in the media asset management side of elmsln but because of automation issues it can't be included on install. Until this issue is resolved by the H5P community (its in their roadmap) here's how to setup H5P after installation of ELMSLN.

- Go to https://h5p.org/update-all-content-types and scroll down to Attachments area
- Download the file with a name like "official-h5p-release-20160219.h5p"
- Go to this page (your path relative to where you install) http://media.elmsln.local/admin/content/h5p and upload the file from H5P

You can customize from there but this has installed all types for you

##Usage
