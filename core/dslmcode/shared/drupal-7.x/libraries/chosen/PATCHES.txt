Dear Future ELMS:LN Developers, 

We have patched the chosen library in Dec 2016 to meet accessibility guidelines. 
(https://github.com/elmsln/elmsln/issues/1532).
This issue has been referenced here in case someone notices we have made a change to this project in the
future and is confused why there is no patch documented. 

Thanks, and hope the future is bright!
